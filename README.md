# follow-mp
An io.js application used to publish mp-voting data to MQTT

## Warning
This repo is very much at hack stage with no attempt of structure or reliability

## Why io.js and not node and what is io.js anyway?
jsdom which is used in this project only supports io.js from version 4.0 onwards and I didn't want to just use an old version.

io.js is a fork of node.js you can download it and use it like node.js to run this application.

The good news is that io.js and node.js plan to merge again soon then we can all get back to normal.. Phew
